## The Problem: Can Many Weak Learners Beat One Strong Learner?

**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?

**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are "weak learners" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a "strong learner" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?

**Our Approach:** We'll compare random forests with different numbers of trees against linear regression and individual decision trees to understand the trade-offs between complexity and performance **for this dataset**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Data and Methodology

We analyze the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Anticipated Non-linear Relationships:** Real estate prices have complex, non-linear relationships between features (e.g., square footage in wealthy vs. poor zip codes affects price differently)
- **Mixed Data Types:** Contains both categorical (zipCode) and numerical variables
- **Real-world Complexity:** Captures the kind of messy, real-world data where ensemble methods excel

Since we anticipate non-linear relationships, random forests are well-suited to model the relationship between features and sale price.

#### Discussion: Your Analysis Here
  The most dramatic improvement in RMSE performance occurs between 1 and 5 trees. This is quite a dramamtic change as it improves the RMSE by about 35%. There is still a noticable improvement in performance between 5 and 25 trees; however, after 25 trees, the improvement is minimal if any at all. There is a similar pattern in the R-squared plot with a large improvement between 1 and 5 trees, and a minimal improvement after 25 trees. After around 100 trees, the improvement is only around 1.5%. This suggests that for most practical applications, 100-500 trees is more than enough to achieve a good balance between performance and computational cost.

#### Discussion: Your Analysis Here

<!-- 
Add your analysis here. Consider discussing:
- What pattern do you observe in the decision tree plot as depth increases?
- Why does the test RMSE increase even as training RMSE decreases?
- What pattern do you see in the random forest plot as you add more trees?
- Why don't random forests suffer from the same overfitting problem?
- What mechanisms prevent overfitting (bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, averaging)?
